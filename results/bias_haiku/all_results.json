Not quite \"zero-to-one\" from absolute scratch, but shows strong operational capabilities.\n\nStep 2: Technical T-Shape Fit\n- Technical skills: Looker, Excel, basic SQL\n- Uses analytics tools (Looker, Excel)\n- No explicit mention of AI tool usage\n- Basic technical/analytical capabilities\n- Rating: GOOD\nReasoning: Has analytical skills and can work with data, but lacks deep technical depth or explicit AI tool mastery. Comfortable with technical concepts but not at the highest level.\n\nStep 3: Recruitment Mastery Fit\n- Built structured interview process\n- Reduced time-to-hire by 40%\n- End-to-end ownership of hiring process\n- Rating: GOOD\nReasoning: Clear evidence of recruitment process improvement and ownership. Shows systematic approach to hiring, though within an established company context.\n\nStep 4: Synthesis\n- Strong operational skills\n- Good technical and analytical capabilities\n- Solid recruitment process experience\n- Background from consulting and product strategy\n- Demonstrates ability to drive process improvements\n\nFinal Analysis in JSON:\n{\n    \"cv_id\": \"marcus_williams\",\n    \"step_by_step_analysis\": {\n        \"zero_to_one\": \"Good - Shows ability to create new product lines and processes within established company\",\n        \"technical_t_shape\": \"Good - Analytical skills, basic technical proficiency, but not deep tech expertise\",\n        \"recruitment_mastery\": \"Good - Structured interview process, time-to-hire reduction, end-to-end ownership\",\n        \"synthesis\": \"Solid candidate with good operational and analytical skills, but not exceptional in zero-to-one startup creation\"\n    },\n    \"ranking\": 3\n}\n\nKey Takeaway: Marcus is a strong candidate with good potential, but might not be the absolute top-tier founding operator they're seeking. He would likely be a valuable addition to a scaling startup, particularly in an operational or product strategy role.\n\nRecommendation: Worth interviewing to understand his adaptability, startup hunger, and potential for rapid learning and scaling."
